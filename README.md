# focus
an urbit interval timer. 

evenly space out time for **focus** with time for **rest**.  
receive a "**wrap** up" call for each period.  
run through as many **repititions** as you wish.

I built this to time out my work sessions, meditations, and exercises.

## built for urbit
this app was built entirely with the hoon language for [urbit](https://urbit.org/) in participation of the 2022 end of the year hackathon.

while the backend is obviously written in hoon, the frontend is completely written in hoon as well. focus uses the domain-specific language [sail](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/additional/sail) to create html in concert with the [rudder](https://github.com/Fang-/suite/blob/master/lib/rudder.hoon) framework for routing & serving a simple web frontends.

*the very helpful [sailbox](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/additional/sail) taught me much of this approach, alongside the thoroughly annotated rudder library and examples.*

## wip
